[id='{context}-pro-keycloak-enablement']
= Enabling {Keycloak}

IMPORTANT: Enabling *{Keycloak}* requires the disabling of *PassportAuth*.

== Prerequisites

. Ensure you have completed xref:getting-started[Getting Started]
. Docker (tested with version: {WFM-RC-DockerVersion})
. Knowledge of {Keycloak} terminologies. See xref:{context}-understanding-keycloak-terminologies[Understanding {Keycloak} Terminologies] section for more information.

NOTE: If you choose to run your own {Keycloak} instance, ensure that a realm is setup for the {PROJECT_NAME} applications
to use. For more information, see xref:{context}-setup-keycloak-realm[Setting up a {Keycloak} Realm] section. 

[id='{context}-run-keycloak-docker-image']
== Running the {Keycloak} Docker Image

. Open a terminal and run the *{Keycloak}* Docker image

[source,bash]
----
docker run -p 8080:8080 feedhenry/raincatcher-keycloak
----

For more information about the *{Keycloak}* Docker Image, see the *{Keycloak}* link:{WFM-RC-KeycloakDockerURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/README.md[README.md].

IMPORTANT: The {Keycloak} realm setup included in this docker image is configured for local development only. Ensure that you provide proper client 
configurations for production environments. See xref:{context}-keycloak-configuration-production[{Keycloak} Configuration for Production Environments] for more information.

[id='{context}-setup-keycloak-realm']
== Setting up a {Keycloak} Realm
NOTE: This step is only valid if you choose to run your own {Keycloak} instance or if you prefer to create your own {Keycloak} realm.
The {Keycloak} Docker image comes with a pre-configured {PROJECT_NAME} realm therefore it does not need to be manually configured.

The {Keycloak} realm can be configured in two different ways:

. Use the existing link:{WFM-RC-KeycloakDockerURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/data_files/raincatcher-realm.json[{Keycloak} realm configuration]
  and import it to your own {Keycloak} instance.
. Create your own {Keycloak} realm.

=== Importing the {Keycloak} Realm Configuration

. Download the link:{WFM-RC-KeycloakDockerURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/data_files/raincatcher-realm.json[{PROJECT_NAME} realm configuration]
. Login to the {Keycloak} admin console. See xref:{context}-accessing-the-keycloak-admin-console[Accessing the {Keycloak} Admin Console] for more information.
. Click 'Add Realm'
. Import the link:{WFM-RC-KeycloakDockerURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/data_files/raincatcher-realm.json[{PROJECT_NAME} realm settings] you downloaded
. Click 'Create'

This will create the demo {PROJECT_NAME} realm which includes the setup for three different clients: raincatcher-portal, raincatcher-mobile and raincatcher-cloud.

IMPORTANT: The provided link:{WFM-RC-KeycloakDockerURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/data_files/raincatcher-realm.json[{PROJECT_NAME} realm configuration] is only configured for
local development. Ensure that you provide proper client configurations for production environments.
See xref:{context}-keycloak-configuration-production[{Keycloak} Configuration for Production Environments] for more information.

[id='{context}-create-own-keycloak-realm']
[discrete]
=== Creating your own {Keycloak} Realm
IMPORTANT: Ensure that you have a deep understanding of {Keycloak}, Node.js and Javascript Adapters before attempting to change any of the configurations below.

See the {Keycloak} link:{WFM-RC-KeycloakURL}server_admin/topics/realms/create.html[realm] documentation for more information on how to
create a new realm within a {Keycloak} instance.

The realm must adhere to the following configurations in order to use it with the {PROJECT_NAME} applications

* Realm settings
+
----
Required SSL: external
----

* Client settings
** The realm must have three different clients for each of the {PROJECT_NAME} applications: Server, Portal and Mobile.
** Server Client: 
+
----
Enabled: true
Client Protocol: openid-connect
Access Type: bearer-only
----

** Portal Client: 
+
----
Enabled: true
Client Protocol: openid-connect
Access Type: public
Standard Flow Enabled: true
Valid Redirect URIs: [Ensure that this is configured with the correct URL patterns]
Web Origins: *

+
----
Enabled: true
Client Protocol: openid-connect
Access Type: public
Standard Flow Enabled: true
Valid Redirect URIs: [Ensure that this is configured with the correct URL patterns]

** For more information on the configurations above, see the {Keycloak} link:{WFM-RC-KeycloakURL}server_admin/topics/clients/client-oidc.html[OpenID Connect configurations] documentation.

* User settings
** Ensure that each user has the following attribute fields:
*** id: Used as an identifier for the user.
*** avatar: A link to the user's avatar image to be displayed on the user panel (Used in the mobile application). 
*** name: The name of the user to be displayed on the user panel (Used in the mobile application).
** For more information on user attributes, see the {Keycloak} link:{WFM-RC-KeycloakURL}server_admin/topics/users/attributes.html[user attributes] documentation.
** Ensure that each user has the appropriate roles. For more information on roles, see xref:{context}-defining-keycloak-access-control[Defining {Keycloak} Access Control].

=== Adding Keycloak Configuration in the Server Application
. Choose which _configuration file_ to edit:
+
.*{Keycloak}* Configuration File
|===
|Area |File Name | File Location

|Development
|link:{WFM-RC-ServerURL}{WFM-RC-Release-Tag}/config-dev.js[config-dev.js]
|/config-dev.js

|Production
|link:{WFM-RC-ServerURL}{WFM-RC-Release-Tag}/config-prod.js[config-prod.js]
|/config-prod.js

|===
+
. Open the configuration file and fill in the missing field values for realm, auth-server-url and resource:
+
[source,javascript]
----
"keycloakConfig":{
                    "realm": "raincatcher",
                    "bearer-only": true,
                    "auth-server-url": "http://localhost:8080/auth",

                    "use-resource-role-mappings": true
                  }
----
NOTE: Ensure that the realm, auth-server-url and resource values corresponds to your client configuration within your 
realm. Ensure that the values for the fields bearer-only, ssl-required and use-resource-role-mappings are not changed.
For more information, see the {Keycloak} link:{WFM-RC-KeycloakURL}securing_apps/topics/oidc/nodejs-adapter.html[Node.js Adapter documentation].

IMPORTANT: Filling in the realm, auth-server-url and resource fields in the keycloakConfig also enables {Keycloak} in the server application
