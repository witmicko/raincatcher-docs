= Introducing the {WFM-RC-NameShort} Datasync Module

The *{WFM-RC-NameShort} Datasync* Module is an implementation of the *{WFM-RC-NameShort}* Sync Framework.
*Datasync* is made up of two applications, the xref:{context}-datasync-cloud-app[Cloud App] and the xref:{context}-datasync-client-app[Client App].
The _Cloud App_ is implemented in the *Datasync* cloud module and the _Client App_ is implemented in the *Datasync* client module.
The primary function of *Datasync* is to synchronize data, for example, a _workorder_, between the _Client Apps_ (mobile) and the _Cloud App_ (running on a backend server).

*Datasync* key features:

- Allows _Client Apps_ (mobile) to use and update data offline (local cache)
- Provides a mechanism to manage bi-directional data synchronization from multiple _Client Apps_ into back-end data stores via the _Cloud App_
- Allows data updates (that is, deltas) to be distributed from the _Cloud App_ to connected clients
- Provides facilities for managing data collisions from multiple updates in the cloud

For advanced usage of the *Datasync* module, see the link:{WFM-RC-SyncFrameworkURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/docs[sync framework documentation].

[id='{context}-datasync-cloud-app']
== Datasync Cloud App
The *Datasync Cloud App* is a wrapper for the *{WFM-RC-NameShort}* link:https://github.com/feedhenry/fh-sync[Datasync server].
The *Datasync Cloud App* creates a server side service that allows _Client Apps_ (mobile) to synchronize offline data to a preferred back-end data store.
By default, the server connects to a backend MongoDB database and stores all client data here.

For instructions on how to implement the *Datasync Cloud App*, see the *Datasync Cloud App* link:{WFM-RC-CoreURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/cloud/datasync/README.md[README.MD]

To view an example, see the *Datasync Cloud App* link:{WFM-RC-CoreUrl}{WFM-RC-Branch}/cloud/datasync/example/index.ts[example].

[id='{context}-datasync-client-app']
== Datasync Client App
The *Datasync Client App* is based on the link:https://github.com/feedhenry/fh-sync-js[sync.js client].
In order to work, the *Datasync Client App* requires the *Datasync Cloud App* to be running on an _Express_ web server.
The _Data Synchonization Library_ can be used for offline storage of the _Client App's_ data.

For instructions on how to implement the *Datasync Client App*, see the *Datasync Client App* link:{WFM-RC-CoreURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/client/datasync-client/README.md[README.MD]

To view an example, see the *Datasync Client App* link:{WFM-RC-CoreUrl}{WFM-RC-Branch}/cloud/datasync/example/index.ts[example].
