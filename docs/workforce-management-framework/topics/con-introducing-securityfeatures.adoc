= Introducing {WFM-RC-NameShort} Security Features

*{WFM-RC-NameShort}* Security is built around a *Security Interface* which abstracts itself from all *{WFM-RC-NameShort}* security libraries.
*{WFM-RC-NameShort}* allows you to integrate a custom security solution.
*{WFM-RC-NameShort}* also provides two out-of-the-box security implementations called link:http://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] and link:http://passportjs.org/[Passport.js].

*Keycloak* and *Passport.js* both provide server side authentication and authorization.
*Keycloak* and *Passport.js* implementations can replace each other without breaking the internal *{WFM-RC-NameShort}* api, modules and also any of the reference applications.

== Authorization using the Security Interface
If you build a custom security implementation, the endpoints are secured in the same way as the *Keycloak* and *Passport.js* implementations.

If you choose to build a custom security implementation, you will need to:

 . Import the link:../../../api/{WFM-RC-Api-Version}{WFM-RC-Api-User-Repository}[EndpointSecurity] interface from *Passport.js*
 . Implement the interface in the custom security implementation
 . Use the _protect_ method to guard routes (the security permissions being role based)

NOTE: All link:https://expressjs.com/[express] routes outside of {WFM-RC-NameShort} modules must implement the link:../../../api/{WFM-RC-Api-Version}{WFM-RC-Api-User-Repository}[EndpointSecurity] Security Interface.

//Pasport.js
== Introducing Passport.js

*Passport.js* is a lightweight authentication middleware solution for Node.js and can be bundled into an existing Node.js server.
*Passport.js* offers a comprehensive set of link:http://passportjs.org/docs/configure[strategies] that support authentication using a username and password, Facebook logon, Twitter logon, and more.

For more information, see link:http://passportjs.org/[passportjs.org].

The *link:{WFM-RC-CoreTreeURL}{WFM-RC-Branch}/cloud/passportauth[PassportAuth Module]* is *{WFM-RC-NameShort}'s* implementation of *Passport.js* and is the default authentication and authorization module for *{WFM-RC-NameShort}*.

== Introducing Keycloak

*Keycloak* is a complete identity management solution. It extends standard authorization and authentication functionality, and comes with all the overheads involved in running a server.
Red Hat recommends using *Keycloak* in production to avail of the many features available for enterprise security including:

* link:https://keycloak.gitbooks.io/documentation/server_admin/topics/sso-protocols.html[Single-Sign On]
* link:https://keycloak.gitbooks.io/documentation/content/server_admin/topics/user-federation.html[User Federation]
* link:https://keycloak.gitbooks.io/documentation/content/server_admin/topics/authentication/x509.html[Client Cert Authentication]
* link:https://keycloak.gitbooks.io/documentation/content/server_admin/topics/authentication/otp-policies.html[2FA with OTP]
* link:https://keycloak.gitbooks.io/documentation/content/server_admin/topics/sessions/administering.html[User Session Management]
* link:https://keycloak.gitbooks.io/documentation/server_admin/topics/events.html[Auditing]
* link:https://keycloak.gitbooks.io/documentation/content/server_admin/topics/threat/brute-force.html[Brute Force Detection]

NOTE: *Keycloak* is _not_ available by default when running the default {WFM-RC-NameShort} solution.

== Choosing Passport.js or Keycloak
*Passport.js*:

* If you want a standalone Node.js based authentication solution that is ready out-of-the-box, choose *Passport.js*.

*Keycloak*:

* If you want a full identity management solution that can be tied into existing saml/ldap/sso solutions, choose *Keycloak*.
