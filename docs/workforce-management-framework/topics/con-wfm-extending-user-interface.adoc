= Extending the User Interface

{Feature} framework provides a set of extension points which allows a developer to modify an Angular User Interface (UI).
All modifications are done by supplying additional modules which provide a set of the Angular.js directives and are used to extend the Mobile and Portal UI.
The {Feature} Application is shipped with the `angularjs-extensions` example that extends the Mobile and Portal Applications:

 * https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-angularjs/tree/master/packages/angularjs-extensions

This Module contains the example directives that are used for demo purposes and it can be used as a template to extend the existing {Feature} UI.

== Extending Workorders

By default, {Feature} provides a minimal set of defined fields for a _workorder_.
Depending on the needs of the business, a developer can add additional data and UI elements, for example, gps location, an address or a description UI element.

=== Building directives
To extend a _workorder_, implement two Angular Directives:

.Angular Directives for Extending a _workorder_
|===
|Angular Directive |Description

|`workorder-data`
|A Data directive used to implement static fields that display data.

|`workorder-data-edit`
|A Data-edit directive used to implement fields that allow modifications to be made to a _workorder's_ data.

|===

NOTE: Directives are to operate (with respect to existing fields) outside of a _workorder_ to avoid naming conflicts, for example, `workorder.data.yourcustomfield`

== User Interface

If the UI requires additional styles or libraries, they are included in the top level application.
The Mobile and Portal Applications contain standard bootstrap and Angular material directives and are found in the top level of the application.
For more information, see the link:https://material.angularjs.org/latest/api[Latest API].

== Development of a template

To build a template, use `grunt wfmTemplate:build`.
To rebuild a template after making changes to it, use `grunt wfmTemplate:watch`.
Each change to a template will require a distribution build.

== Integration

An _Entry File_ exposes a new implementation of an Angular module and this can be mounted into a root application module.
A new NPM module should be integrated into both the Mobile and the Portal Application, so that the User can view the data belonging to the new _workorder_.

NOTE: The {Feature} Application contains the `@raincatcher-examples/angularjs-extensions` module. If you add a new custom module, remove the {Feature} Application to avoid collisions.

== Publishing

For {Feature} to consume a module, ensure that it is published to the public or private NPM registry.
When publishing a custom module, ensure that the package's name and the author's name are updated.
If you choose not to publish a custom module, you can include all directives directly in the {Feature} application.
