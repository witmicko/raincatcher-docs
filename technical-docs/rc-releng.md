# RainCatcher release

### Publishing modules and generating applications

The repository also includes a set of commands for publishing both the standalone modules and the contained applications.

- `npm run publish:prepare` - builds TS sources and setups dependencies for publishing packages
- `npm run publish:test` - runs a test of publishing packages to a local npm registry via the [Verdaccio](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio) project
- `npm run publish:full` - prepares packages and tries to publish to the public registry, requires human input for confirming the version bumps, see the [lerna publish](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#publish) documentation for more information.
- `npm run publish:dry` - does a dry-run of the publish scripts for local test purposes, avoiding any permanent changes to git history or npm registries
- `npm run publish:demo-server` - publishes the `demo/server` application to a separate repository as part of the project's inclusion in the [Red Hat Mobile Application Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/mobile/application-platform)

#### Procedure

##### raincatcher-core

1. Generate a separate local branch for release, i.e. `git checkout -b release-{new semver}`
2. Run `npm run publish:full` to compile sources and start `lerna publish`
3. Select the appropriate version bump when prompted via the console. If the operation is aborted at this point, only `lerna publish` is needed to be run again to continue.
4. The core packages should be published to the public NPM registry and internal references should be updated. Note: By default, `lerna publish` will create a git tag that points to this branch, so in a later step we must regenerate this tag to point to the release commit on master.
5. Run `npm run publish:demo-server` to publish the demo application to the template repository, it will be published under a branch called `release-{semver in lerna.json}`
6. If alignment with a platform release is necessary, clone the https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-server repository and copy the new branch to one with the required name:

```
git clone git@github.com:feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-server.git
cd raincatcher-server/
git push origin release-{semver}:FH-{RHMAP version}
```

7. Open a PR against https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-core `master` from the new release branch
8. After the PR is merged, regenerate the version tag to point to the merged result in master:

```
# on raincatcher-core/
git checkout master
git pull # pulls merged PR update
git tag -d v{semver} # deletes local tag
git push --delete origin v{semver} # deletes remote tag if necessary
git tag v{semver} # recreates the tag pointing to current HEAD which should be master
git push --tags
```

##### raincatcher-angularjs

This procedure is very similar to the one for Core, except it currently involves a few extra manual steps:

1. Generate a separate local branch for release, i.e. `git checkout -b release-{new semver}`
2. EXTRA: Ensure the raincatcher-core clone in the /core directory is up to date with the latest released version. If releasing all modules, core should be published first. Refer to the previous section.
3. EXTRA: Manually bump the versions of the dependencies upon `core` packages in the raincatcher-angularjs repository to match any new versions:

  - Use `lerna ls` to confirm the used packages from `core` and their versions (currently `@raincatcher/datasync-client`, `@raincatcher/wfm` and `@raincatcher/logger`)
  - Manually update any references to them in `package.json` files in the `angularjs` repo (currently this seems to affenct only the demo applications)

4. Run `npm run publish:full` to compile sources and start `lerna publish`
5. Select the appropriate version bump when prompted via the console. If the operation is aborted at this point, only `lerna publish` is needed to be run again to continue.
6. The packages should be published to the public NPM registry and internal references should be updated. Note: By default, `lerna publish` will create a git tag that points to this branch, so in a later step we must regenerate this tag to point to the release commit on master.
8. Run `npm run publish:demo-mobile` to publish the demo application to the template repository, it will be published under a branch called `release-{semver in lerna.json}`
7. Run `npm run publish:demo-portal` to publish the demo application to the template repository, it will be published under a branch called `release-{semver in lerna.json}`
9. If alignment with a platform release is necessary, clone the https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-server and `mobile` repositories and copy the new branch to one with the required name:

```
git clone git@github.com:feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-server.git
cd raincatcher-server/
git push origin release-{semver}:FH-{RHMAP version}

git clone git@github.com:feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-mobile.git
cd raincatcher-mobile/
git push origin release-{semver}:FH-{RHMAP version}
```

10. Open a PR against https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-angularjs `master` from the new release branch
11. After the PR is merged, regenerate the version tag to point to the merged result in master:

```
# on raincatcher-angularjs/
git checkout master
git pull # pulls merged PR update
git tag -d v{semver} # deletes local tag
git push --delete origin v{semver} # deletes remote tag if necessary
git tag v{semver} # recreates the tag pointing to current HEAD which should be master
git push --tags
```

### Generate api documentation

1. Use previously checked out https://github.com/feedhenry-raincatcher/raincatcher-core repository

2. Execute documentation generator

  npm run docs

> Note: You may need to update VERSION environment variable in the script for new releases.

3. Go to checked out documentation repository

  cd raincatcher-docs

4. Install required packages

  npm install

5. Build documentation

  npm run buildAsciiDocs
  npm run buildApiDocs

6. Publish to page:

> NOTE: THIS OPERATION WILL UPDATE PUBLIC WEBSITE.
PLEASE TEST IF WEBSITE AND DOCUMENTATION WORK before release

    npm run publish
